## Stupid Simple URL Redirection 

### Why? 

 * You want a URL shortner and redirector. That is http://go.mydomain.com/magic should go http://www.myreallylongcomapnyname/geography/language/product/campaigncode/blah
 * You are not looking to build a SEO business based on URL shortening services.
 * You don't want to use all the multi-million dollar URL shortners.
 * You don't want to contribute to link rot by using someone else's short lived "SEO startup"
 * You are comfortable using a text editor. 
 * You understand that a URL shortening "service" is not.
 * You know how to edit a file, configure a web server.
 * You don't want to "maintain" this service anymore than getting a root canal.
 * Less is more.

### How

Step 1: 

 * Figure out a domain or a sub domain you want to install this. Eg: http://go.mydomain.com/
 * TODO
